# BlackTrack
A bet tracker for webcam games of blackjack.

## To do
* Store wallets, bets, and totals in a permanent database rather than temporary memory.
* Integrate standing bets into `$closebets` commands
* Buy-in option
* Fix the evens-only issue
* Make the #blackjack channel more like an app than a chat stream (delete messages when no longer relevant)
* Create `$blackjack` as an alias of `$pay @user 2.5x`
* Add emoji response support?
